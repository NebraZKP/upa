Gnark sample data generated by the test code at https://github.com/NebraZKP/gnark/blob/upa-test-data/examples/nebra/nebra_data_test.go

The "invalid" gnark data are actually valid gnark proofs, but they use configurations not supported by UPA.

The `public_commitment...` files use a Pedersen commitment to public input values.

The `private_commitment_wrong_hash...` files commit to a private witness values, but the proving backend used SHA256 as the hash-to-field function. (UPA hashes to field using Keccak.)
